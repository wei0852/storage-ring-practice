## summary
this code use Courant-Snyder method to solve the global parameters of lattice and twiss parameters along the lattice.

this is just my practice of accelerator physics learning, the functions and precision of results are limited, and the 
calculation speed is a little slow.

I've tried several examples. it works well on hls-II. However, on esrf(one of OPA's examples), its precision becomes 
not so good, and can't calculate chromaticity with sextupole. I haven't found out the reason yet.
